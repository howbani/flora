# Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) Simulator

FLORA (Fuzzy based Load-Balanced Opportunistic Routing for Asynchronous Duty-Cycled WSNs)
----

The nodes close to the sink have to undertake more duties than the rest of network nodes, which imposes the nodes close to the sink to deplete their energy faster and significantly degrading the performance of network. Therefore, the nodes located in different positions should play different roles during the routing process. 
	We call this the location characteristics of nodes or the roles of nodes. FLORA achieves the location characteristics of nodes by introducing the fuzzy logic theory into WSNs. 
	To simulate FLORA, a simulator is developed based on [https://github.com/haobani/WSNSIM].

Experimental Setting
-----
When the simulation starts, the nodes whose initial energy is 0.5 Jouls are randomly deployed in a 400m*400m sensing field. The sink node starting with infinite energy is positioned in the center of the field. All nodes run BOX-MAC, hava the same duty cycles and consume the energy according to the First Order Radio Model.
	In our simulations, we assume that the network has the ideal propagation condition by utilizing the Free Space Propagation Model and that the network generates a data packet from a random sensor node to the sink in each 0.1s.
	The size of the data packets is set to 1024bits. The default active time and sleep time are 2s and 1s respectively.
